# Output Format
First, reason through the problem step-by-step in natural language.
Explain your thinking process, analysis, and any intermediate steps needed to arrive at the final answer.
After your reasoning, provide the final structured output wrapped in a single ```json code block.
Make sure to provide exactly ONE structured output in a SINGLE code block at the very end of your response.
Do not include multiple code blocks or multiple structured outputs.
The structured output must be the final element of your response with no text after the code block.
If you include any headers or explanations, the JSON MUST still appear only inside that final ```json code block.
